Current colors
==============


This is what we can find in the current CSS.


.. code-block::

  $color-1: #ffffff
  $color-2: #ff0000
  $color-3: #fdc894
  $color-4: #f3f3f3
  $color-5: #eaeaea
  $color-6: #dff0d8
  $color-7: #dddddd
  $color-8: #dd4814
  $color-9: #bbbbbb
  $color-10: #a7d499
  $color-11: #666666
  $color-12: #5bc0de
  $color-13: #4e4a4a
  $color-14: #333333
  $color-15: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.3)
  $color-16: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1)
  $color-17: #000000




Consolidated graphical charter
==============================


This is a suggestion, based on current colors, but with some adjustments. Some colors (not necessary) have been removed. In favor of new colors.

This proposal was made on the principle that:

* The basic colors of the themes "dark" and "Light" should be defined

* The 4 basic colors of all CSS frameworks should be defined:

    * Green: Success
    * Blue: Information
    * Orange: Alert
    * Red: Danger

Gray has been added to allow color gradations for the "dark" and "light" themes.
