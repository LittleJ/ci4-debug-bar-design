# CI4 DEBUG BAR DESIGN

I proposed an improvement of the debug bar, by adding a "dark" mode: https://github.com/codeigniter4/CodeIgniter4/pull/2478


A community member suggested graphical improvements to the debug bar. But I think that before considering changes, it would be interesting to optimize what already exists.


To improve the graphical interface, I think there are two aspects:

* The structure

* The colors
